###Walkthrough
If you aren't able to attend and want to go through a walkthrough on your own, all materials are available in the [walkthrough directory].

Which also includes a [single day] format for presentations.


###How to Run the App
#### Running Locally
First, make sure you have [Node.js] installed ([npm] is Node's companion package manager). This application was built using Node 0.12, but it should work fine with most versions of Node and [io.js].

See these instructions for help [installing Node].

In the terminal, run `npm install` to pull in dependencies, followed by `npm start` to start the webpack dev server which will open a Chrome window.

* Note for windows users: environment variables are set differently so
  please use `npm run start-windows`

#### Docker Setup
If you are familiar with Docker, or are willing to learn it, there is a Dockerfile provided that will simply call `npm start` by default.  To get this running you could:
- CD into the working directory
- docker build . -t react-bootcamp
- docker run -p 8001:8001 react-bootcamp

NOTE: If you want to have the live updates enabled, you would need to properly mount the app directory as a volume.  Ex on Mac: `docker run -v $(pwd)/app:/app/app -p 8001:8001 react-bootcamp`
